  <p>Diego Armando Maradona Franco was an Argentine professional football player and manager, widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award, alongside Pelé.   

    Maradona was born in Buenos Aires on October 30, 1960, and began his professional career with Argentinos Juniors in 1976. He quickly became known for his exceptional ball control, dribbling skills, and vision, and he soon attracted the attention of European clubs. In 1982, he signed with Barcelona, where he won the Copa del Rey and the Copa de la Liga.   
    
    In 1984, Maradona moved to Napoli, where he became a club legend. He led Napoli to their first Serie A title in 1987 and their second in 1990. He also won the Coppa Italia with Napoli in 1987 and 1990.   
    
    Maradona was also a key player for the Argentine national team. He captained Argentina to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where he scored two of the most famous goals in World Cup history: the "Hand of God" goal against England and the "Goal of the Century" against England. He also led Argentina to the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup, where they were defeated by West Germany.   
    
    Maradona retired from playing in 1997 and later became a manager. He managed several clubs, including Argentina, Al-Fujairah, and Dorados de Sinaloa. He died on November 25, 2020, at the age of 60.
