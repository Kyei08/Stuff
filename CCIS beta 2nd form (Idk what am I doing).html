<p>The Campus Capital Investment Society (CCIS): Bridging Academia, Corporate Engagement, and Market Knowledge
  The Campus Capital Investment Society (CCIS), initially founded in 2024 by Johan Venter, a third-year Eduvos Pretoria student, has been rebranded under the visionary leadership of 2nd Year Bcom General Student Vukosi Mnisi. This rebranding, which took place on 7th November 2024, reflects a transformative step in the society's mission to bridge the gap between academic financial theory and practical financial literacy. With its foundation in Pretoria, CCIS aims to expand its reach to all 12 Eduvos campuses and beyond, fostering a financially empowered and career-ready student community.</p>
  <h2>Vission</h2>

  <p>These guiding principles aim to empower students, not only within the confines of academia but also in their broader professional and entrepreneurial pursuits.</p>
